# Chrome Web Store Listing — Shortmoji

## Name
Shortmoji — Emoji Shortcodes

## Summary (132 char max)
The colon is mightier than the mouse. Type :emoji: shortcodes anywhere — no picker, no hunting, no nonsense.

## Description

**The colon is mightier than the mouse.**

Stop hunting through emoji pickers. Just type :smile: and get 😄. Anywhere on the web.

**How it works:**
• Type : or # followed by an emoji name (e.g. :rocket: or #rocket)
• A dropdown shows matching emoji — pick with arrow keys + Enter
• Or type the full shortcode :rocket: for instant replacement
• Works in text inputs, Gmail, Notion, Slack web, and any contenteditable field

**1870+ emoji shortcodes** — the same ones you already know from Slack, GitHub, and Discord.

**Features:**
• Instant replace — type :fire: and it becomes 🔥 immediately
• Two triggers — :fire (Slack-style) or #fire (quick pound key)
• Autocomplete dropdown with keyboard navigation
• Toggle auto-replace on/off
• Toggle the whole extension on/off
• Works everywhere — textarea, input, contenteditable
• Zero dependencies — pure vanilla JS

**What this extension does NOT do:**
• Track you
• Collect data
• Phone home
• Show ads
• Ask for your credit card
• Upsell you on "premium emoji"
